===Q: Does BWHF Agent detect only autogather/autotrain?===
A: No. By default, the agent stops scanning further actions of a player if a hack has been identified. And since autogather/autotrain is the first hack it looks for, that is the most common hack that it will alert for. You can disable this _fast scan_ by unchecking the "During a replay scan if a player is found hacking..." option on the general settings tab.

===Q: Does BWHF Agent detect maphacks?===
A: Some but not all by far.

===Q: Why doesn't work the player checker for me in the game lobby?===
A: The 3 main important things requarding to player checker: 1) you have to press the Print Screen key, 2) it will only alert for hackers reported with the same gateway you have set on your autoscan tab, 3) as far as I know Advloader disables making screenshot in the lobby, so it probably won't work with Advloader on.
