===Q: Does BWHF Agent detect only autogather/autotrain?===
A: No. By default, the agent stops scanning further actions of a player if a hack has been identified. And since autogather/autotrain is the first hack it looks for, that is the most common hack that it will alert for. You can disable this _fast scan_ by unchecking the "During a replay scan if a player is found hacking..." option on the general settings tab.

===Q: Does BWHF Agent detect maphacks?===
A: Some but not all by far.
