#summary Describes the online hacker database.

=BWHF Online Hacker Database=

The BWHF online hacker database is available here:

[http://94.199.240.39/hackerdb/hackers]

On that page you can list, search, filter, sort existing hackers.

==Filters==

You can filter the hackers with various properties. Only those reports will be counted and displayed which match all the filters.

A report/hacker will be counted if:
 * *Hacker name:* the hacker name contains this lowercased text
 * *Gateways:* the report is assigned to one the selected gateways
 * *Game engines:* the replay of the report has been played with one of the selected game engines
 * *Map name:* the map of the replay of the report contains this lowercased text
 * *Min report count:* the hacker has received at least reports of this count
 * *Reported with key:* the report was done using this key; you can use this to list your own reports/hackers

==Sorting==

You can sort the results by clicking on the column you want to sort by. Clicking on the same column again will change the sort order (reverse it).

The columns and their meaning:
 * *#:* the ordinal of the hacker in the current sorting
 * *Name:* the name of the hacker
 * *Gateway:* the gatway of the hacker
 * *Report count:* the number of reports of the hacker
 * *First reported:* the date and time of when the first report of the hacker arrived; this has the meaning of how long has been the hacker hacking, or rather when was he recorded in the database
 * *Last reported:* the date and time of when the last report of the hacker arrived; this has the meaning of when was the last activity of the hacker, or rather when was he last recorded

The *First reported* column shows how old the hacker is using hacks and the *Last reported* column shows how recently was the hacker active (based on the reports arrived to the BWHF system).
