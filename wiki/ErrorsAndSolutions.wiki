=BWHF Agent errors and solutions=

==Can't start BWHF Agent?==
First check if you have Java installed in your system. BWHF Agent requires Java 6.0 or higher. Type in a command window to check what version and if you have Java installed:
{{{
java -version
}}}
You can download and install Java here: [http://www.java.com/download]

Next thing you should know is you have to start it with `BWHFAgent.cmd` and not with the jar file.

==I have Java installed, still can't start==
This might be because even if you have java installed in your system, the java.exe and the javaw.exe commands are available because their folder is not in the execution path.

You can fix this in 2 ways:
 * You can add the java installation folder to your PATH environment. In fact you have to add the bin subfolder of it where actually the java exe files are located. For example this folder can be: `"C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin"`
 * You can edit the `BWHFAgent.cmd` and `BWHFAgent-console.cmd` scripts, and add the full path of java.exe where it is installed. Don't forget to put it in quotes if the directiry names contain spaces. For example: `"C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe" -Djava.library.path=...`

==Autoscan doesn't work?==
You have to set Starcraft directory to let BWHF Agent know where to look for !LastReplay.rep.

==Can't report hackers?==
You have to select your gateway corresponding to where you play in order to report hackers. Moreover you need a valid autorization key. You can read about these keys here: AuthorizationKeys

==I think BWHF Agent misbehaving, but I don't see any errors==
Try to start the program with the `BWHFAgent-console.cmd` script. That way you get a console where you might see some errors and details.
