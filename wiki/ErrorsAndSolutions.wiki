=BWHF Agent errors and solutions=

==Can't start BWHF Agent?==
First check if you have Java installed in your system. BWHF Agent requires Java 6.0 or higher. Type in a command window to check what version and if you have Java installed:
{{{
java -version
}}}
You can download and install Java here: [http://www.java.com/download]

You can start the program with any of the following programs/scripts:
 * `BWHFAgent.exe` (preferred)
 * `BWHFAgent.cmd`
 * `BWHFAgent-console.cmd` (opens a console window for detailed error messages; good for debugging)
Or on linux platform:
 * `BWHFAgent.sh`

==I have Java installed, still can't start==
BWHF Agent requires the 32 bit version of java. If you installed the 64 version, please install the 32 bit version too, and edit the starter scripts to use the 32 bit version's java.exe and javaw.exe.

Another cause can be that even if you might have java installed in your system, the java.exe and the javaw.exe commands are not available because their folder is not in the execution path.

You can fix this in 2 ways:
 * You can add the java installation folder to your `PATH` environment. In fact you have to add the bin subfolder of it where actually the java exe files are located. For example this folder can be: `"C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin"` Google it how to set/change the `PATH` environment variable.
 * You can edit the `BWHFAgent.cmd` and `BWHFAgent-console.cmd` scripts, and add the full path of java.exe where it is installed. Don't forget to put it in quotes if the directory names contain spaces. For example: `"C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe" -Djava.library.path=...`

Tip: you can check the value of the `PATH` environment variable by typing `PATH` in a command window.

==Autoscan doesn't work?==
You have to set Starcraft directory to let BWHF Agent know where to look for !LastReplay.rep.

==Can't report hackers?==
You have to select your gateway corresponding to where you play in order to report hackers. Moreover you need a valid autorization key. You can read about these keys here: AuthorizationKeys

==I think BWHF Agent misbehaving, but I don't see any errors==
Try to start the program with the `BWHFAgent-console.cmd` script on windows platform. That way you get a console where you might see some errors and details.
