#summary Version history and changes in BWHF Agent.

=BWHF Agent version history=

*Features and changes in the upcoming new version:*
 * A new *Charts* tab which can visualize players' APM from replays.
 * Extracting game chat now contains more info about players: their in-game colors and the number of their actions (along with their races and APMs).
 * Fixed a bug which caused the agent's window to "blink" or resized when some button was pressed ("Check key" button for example).

====1.30 2009-02-18====
 * New setting to create and open a *detailed HTML summary report* at the end of manual scan. These HTML reports are also saved in the `HTML reports` folder so you can view them later or share them on the internet.
 * Added a button to the manual scan tab to open previous HTML reports.
 * New setting to clean the 'hack' flag from replays where no hackers were found during the scan on the manual scan tab.
 * Added a *progress bar* to the manual scan, PCX converter and Game chat tabs.
 * Game chat extraction now contains more info about players (race and APM).
 * Fixed a bug which occasionally caused `LastReplay.rep` to be saved and scanned (and reported hackers if found) twice when changed.
 * Players using latency changer program might occasionally got reported using autogather/autotrain hack. This is no longer the case.
 * Logged text areas have more descriptive titles.
 * Renamed `settings.properites` to `settings.properties`.

====1.20 2009-02-03====
 * A new *PCX converter* tab which can convert your Starcraft PCX screenshot files to JPG, GIF, PNG or BMP image files. The tab has an auto converter feature which automatically converts your Starcraft screenshots so you don't have to do it manually. You will find the JPG (or PNG or GIF or BMP) screenshots in your Starcraft directory right away as if Starcraft would save the screenshots in JPG format (or in the format of your choice) in the first place.
 * A new *Game chat* tab which can extract replay header information and game chat from replays and save them to text files.
 * It is displayed if Starcraft folder is set correctly, and the 'Start/Switch to Starcraft' button is enabled based on that.
 * Moved `BWHFAgent.jar` to the `lib` folder to avoid launching misunderstanding and added a `BWHFAgent.exe` starter program.
 * Fixed an error which caused scanning a replay with no actions to fail.
 * Fine-tuned the general multicommand hack detection to fix 2 false alerts.
 * Updated the binary replay parser to recognize and parse game chat commands properly (which was introduced in Starcraft version 1.16).

----
====1.10 2009-01-12====
 * Added option to define the position (beginning or end) where to flag hacker replays on the Manual scan tab.
 * Added volume control setting for alert sounds.
 * Handling a kind of replay corruption (fixes a false alert).
 * Hack report at the end of manual scan is built with no case sensitivity in hacker's name, and the list is sorted by name.

----
====1.00 2008-12-30====
 * Fixed a bug which caused the scan process to hang when tried to scan a replay with actions starting at iteration 0.
 * Fixed a false multicommand hack alert.
 * Changed the generated names of the autosaved replays (the previous one was too long and Starcraft couldn't play it without renaming).
