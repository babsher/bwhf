=BWHF Agent version history=

*New ideas and features to consider (post your comments and votes on these):*
 * Utility to convert pcx screenshot image files to jpg or gif or png.
 * Utility to extract game chat from replays (to text files).

*Upcoming features and changes in the next version:*
 * It is displayed if Starcraft folder is set correctly, and the 'Start/Switch to Starcraft' button is enabled based on that.
 * Moved `BWHFAgent.jar` to the `lib` folder to avoid launching misunderstanding.
 * Fixed an error which caused replays with no actions to fail.
 * Fine-tuned the general multicommand hack detection to fix 2 false alerts.
 * Updated the binary replay parser to recognize and parse game chat commands properly (which was introduced in Starcraft version 1.16).

====1.10 2009-01-12====
 * Added option to define the position (beginning or end) where to flag hacker replays on the Manual scan tab.
 * Added volume control setting for alert sounds.
 * Handling a kind of replay corruption (fixes a false alert).
 * Hack report at the end of manual scan is built with no case sensitivity in hacker's name, and the list is sorted by name.

====1.00 2008-12-30====
 * Fixed a bug which caused the scan process to hang when tried to scan a replay with actions starting at iteration 0.
 * Fixed a false multicommand hack alert.
 * Changed the generated names of the autosaved replays (the previous one was too long and Starcraft couldn't play it without renaming).
