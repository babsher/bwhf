=BWHF Agent version history=

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

===Features and changes in the upcoming new release:===
 * Players' action list is now displayed in the charts tab. Action list or any part of it *can be exported* simply by selecting and coping it to the cliboard.
 * Added *Jump to iteration* option to jump to any iteration or one being _close_ to it.
 * Added a *Search text* option to the action list. The search can be a fraction of a word and can aim anything that is visible in the action list: player name, action name, unit name etc.
 * Added a *Filter actions* option to filter the displayed actions. This option filters out the actions that do not contain the entered filter text. This can be used for example to filter down to any select actions (like Select, Shift Select, Shift Deselect, Hotkey Select etc.) or to find any actions that relates to Zealot (Train Zealot, Upgrade Zealot speed). The filter text might contain several words which will be in logical AND connection by default. However you can use logical OR connection by writing `or` between words. These 2 (AND and OR) can be combined. For example the result of setting the filter text: "`hatch or train zealot or dragoon`" will display only those actions that contain the single word 'hatch' or contain both words 'Train' and 'Zealot' or contains the single word dragoon.
 * Replaced the starter `BWHFAgent.exe` file because the old one was flagged as a trojan by some minor antivirus programs.
 * If a replay file is passed to any of the starter scripts or exe, it will be opened in the charts tab by default. If you associate replay files with one of BWHF Agent's script files, the replay will be opened in the charts tab if you double click on the replay (this only works with the script files).
 * Detection of invalid ally and vision commands which can be used to drop players.
 * Components are now centered properly when window is enlarged.

===1.40 2009-03-04===
 * A new *Charts* tab. Setting for visalizing all players on separate or on one chart with any chart type (gives the possibility to compare the speed of players on the Build order chart for example). Setting to draw charts using players' in-game colors to easily associate. Setting for auto-disabling players with less than 30 APM.
 * *APM* chart to visualize players' APMs customizable by detail level in pixels. Detected hack actions are marked in the charts.
 * *Hotkeys* chart to show players' hotkey usage. Setting for showing/hiding select hotkeys.
 * *Build order* chart to visualize buildings and units built/trained by the players. Setting to show/hide units in the charts. Setting for showing/hiding worker units (such as SCV, probe, drone). Note that only the build/train/hatch actions are visualized which are not neccessarily the same as the buildings/units that really get built/trained. Setting for changing the build order display levels.
 * *Now available for Linux too!*
 * New setting on the general settings tab: "Start folder when selecting replay files". This folder will be the start location when you want to select replay files on any tab.
 * Extracting game chat now contains more info about players: their in-game colors and the number of their actions (along with their races and APMs).
 * Updated the scan engine to detect a new variation of autogather/multicommand hack.
 * Fixed a bug which caused the agent's window to "blink" or resized when some button was pressed ("Check key" example).

===1.30 2009-02-18===
 * New setting to create and open a *detailed HTML summary report* at the end of manual scan. These HTML reports are also saved in the `HTML reports` folder so you can view them later or share them on the internet.
 * Added a button to the manual scan tab to open previous HTML reports.
 * New setting to clean the 'hack' flag from replays where no hackers were found during the scan on the manual scan tab.
 * Added a *progress bar* to the manual scan, PCX converter and Game chat tabs.
 * Game chat extraction now contains more info about players (race and APM).
 * Fixed a bug which occasionally caused `LastReplay.rep` to be saved and scanned (and reported hackers if found) twice when changed.
 * Players using latency changer program might occasionally got reported using autogather/autotrain hack. This is no longer the case.
 * Logged text areas have more descriptive titles.
 * Renamed `settings.properites` to `settings.properties`.

===1.20 2009-02-03===
 * A new *PCX converter* tab which can convert your Starcraft PCX screenshot files to JPG, GIF, PNG or BMP image files. The tab has an auto converter feature which automatically converts your Starcraft screenshots so you don't have to do it manually. You will find the JPG (or PNG or GIF or BMP) screenshots in your Starcraft directory right away as if Starcraft would save the screenshots in JPG format (or in the format of your choice) in the first place.
 * A new *Game chat* tab which can extract replay header information and game chat from replays and save them to text files.
 * It is displayed if Starcraft folder is set correctly, and the 'Start/Switch to Starcraft' button is enabled based on that.
 * Moved `BWHFAgent.jar` to the `lib` folder to avoid launching misunderstanding and added a `BWHFAgent.exe` starter program.
 * Fixed an error which caused scanning a replay with no actions to fail.
 * Fine-tuned the general multicommand hack detection to fix 2 false alerts.
 * Updated the binary replay parser to recognize and parse game chat commands properly (which was introduced in Starcraft version 1.16).

===1.10 2009-01-12===
 * Added option to define the position (beginning or end) where to flag hacker replays on the Manual scan tab.
 * Added volume control setting for alert sounds.
 * Handling a kind of replay corruption (fixes a false alert).
 * Hack report at the end of manual scan is built with no case sensitivity in hacker's name, and the list is sorted by name.

----
===1.00 2008-12-30===
 * Fixed a bug which caused the scan process to hang when tried to scan a replay with actions starting at iteration 0.
 * Fixed a false multicommand hack alert.
 * Changed the generated names of the autosaved replays (the previous one was too long and Starcraft couldn't play it without renaming).
