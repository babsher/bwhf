*Remember that if you were using a previous version and you download a new verison, you have to reenter your key and set again all your settings OR alternatively you can copy your old `settings.properties` file to keep all the old settings (along with the key).*

Bear in mind that the server was moved to a new location on 2009-09-18 which has a new IP address. Versions earlier than 2.61 used direct IP reference to the BWHF server which will not work anymore therefore they cannot reach the server. (Releases from 2.61 uses the working bwhf.net domain.)
