#summary This page describes how replay search works in BWHF Agent.

=Replay search in BWHF Agent=

The Replay search tab in BWHF Agent let's you search replays by various conditions. If you don't touch any filters, the search returns all the input replays. If you specify some conditions, they will be in logical _AND_ connection.

==Replay filter fields==

==Search execution buttons==
Search can be executed by specifying the set of replay to search. The currently running search can be terminated at any time with the *Stop current search* button.

There are several buttons to define the source replays of search:
 * *Select files* button: you can select multiple replay files to search.
 * *Select folders to search recursively* button: you can select folders of replays to search recursively.
 * *Repeat search* button: the search will be repeated on the same replays as the last search but with the new specified or changed filters of course.
 * *Search in previous results (narrows previous result)* button: the search will be executed on the result of the last search. You can filter previous results with this button.
