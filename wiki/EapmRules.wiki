#summary Rules used by my EAPM algorithm

=EAPM Rules=

The APM/EAPM charts calculates and shows APM and EAPM values based on my algorithm. APM stands for Action Per Minute. APM measures the amount of commands given by a player. EAPM stands for Effective APM. EAPM measures the amount of useful/effective commands given by a player. The algorithm uses different rules to classify actions _effective_ or _ineffective_.

*Commands that are considered to be _ineffective_:*

 * Unit queue overflow: if more than 5 units/subunit is trained in a short time
 * Too fast cancel: if a train, research, upgrade, hatch command gets cancelled right away
 * Too fast repetition of some command: move, stop, hold, hotkey assign
 * Too fast switch away from a selected unit or reselecting the same units (by too fast I mean there is not even time to check the state of the units); double tapping a hotkey to center a group of units is NOT considered ineffective
 * Repetition of some commands (without time restriction): hatch, morph, upgrade, research, build, cancel

*Commands that are _NOT_ considered ineffective:*
 * Double tapping a hotkey to center the group
 * Selecting unit(s) or building to check its state but not giving new order to it.
