#summary This page describes how replay search works in BWHF Agent.

=Player Matcher=
Player matcher allows you to select any replays, and it will analyze all of them and compare all players across the selected replays individually. Afte the analysis it displays the result in a table. The table contains the *extent of authoritativeness* of the comparision, the *matching probability* of the 2 players and the names of the players and the replay files. You can choose whether to compare players with same name too. The comparisions can go really high if you select many replays, so there is option to set the display tresholds of the authoritativeness and the matching probability.
