===Step 1 – Checking your version of Java===
Open up the Terminal.
{{{
The Terminal can be found in the Utilites folder that in turn is located under Applications.
}}}

Don’t worry, you won’t have to do a lot of scary stuff in the Terminal and if I was able to figure out what to do, you’ll be able to do this too!

Once in the Terminal, write the following:

`java -version`

Now, you should get a few lines of text back but the only thing we are interested in here is the version of Java that is running.

If your version of Java is 1.6 or higher skip step 2.

===Step 2 – Setting up Java 1.6===
If you haven’t got Java version 1.6 or higher, you will have to go and download it from [http://support.apple.com/downloads/Java_for_Mac_OS_X_10_5_Update_1 Apple’s homepage].
