=BWHF Authorization keys=

==What is this key?==
The key authenticates its owner toward the BWHF hacker data base. Only those who possess a valid authorization key can report hackers to the central hacker data base.

==How can I get a key?==
Keys cannot be purchased. I give keys for free for those who can be trusted. This includes my friends and people I play with on battle.net. Of course this is a very limited group of people.

Moreover I provide keys upon requests to admins of Starcraft websites and communities. The number of keys given to admins is practically not limited. Then the admins are responsible who to give the keys.
