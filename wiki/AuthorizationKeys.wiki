=BWHF Authorization keys=

==What is this key?==
The key authenticates its owner toward the BWHF hacker data base. Only those who possess a valid authorization key can report hackers to the central hacker data base.

==How can I get a key?==
Keys cannot be purchased. I give keys for free for those who can be trusted. This includes my friends and people I play with on battle.net. Of course this is a very limited group of people.

Moreover I provide keys upon requests to admins of known Starcraft websites and communities. First of course one has to prove he/she is really an admin of he/she claims to be. The number of keys to be given to admins is not limited. Then the admins are responsible to distribute the keys to people they know and they trust.

If I don't know you, don't come to me begging for a key. Instead ask an admin of a known Starcraft community who knows you and trusts you to get you a key.

==Key revocation==
If I find that a key is used inappropriate, the key can be revocated without any warning. Revocation of a key means all reports that were done using that key will be excluded from all queries like they were never happened. Optionally those reports can be deleted forever.
