=BWHF Authorization keys=

==What is this key?==
The key authenticates its owner toward the BWHF hacker data base server. It's like the CD key for Starcraft, you need a valid CD key for Starcraft which authenticates you toward Blizzard's battle.net servers. Only those who possess a valid authorization key can report hackers to the central hacker data base. Reports with invalid key are discarded.

==How can I get a key?==
Keys cannot be purchased. I give keys for free for those who can be trusted. This includes my friends and people I play with on battle.net. Of course this is a very limited group of people.

Moreover I provide keys upon requests to admins of known Starcraft websites and communities. Once I verified that the requestor is truly the admin he/she claimed to be, I provide as many keys as needed. Then the admins are responsible to distribute the keys to people they know and whom they trust.

If I don't know you, don't come to me begging for a key. Instead ask an admin of a known Starcraft community who knows you and trusts you to get you a key.

==Key revocation==
If I find that a key is used inappropriately, the key can be revocated without any warning. Revocation of a key means all reports that were done using that key will be excluded from all queries like they were never happened. Optionally those reports can be deleted forever.
